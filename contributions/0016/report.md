# Report

### Brief description of the device used

- Device: Clevo NP50SND
- Architecture: x86-64

### Time taken to compute the contribution

Almost 10 minutes

### Hash of the challenge file

The BLAKE2 hash of the challenge is the following:

```bash
00c80ae1163db30bcccda8e3d1cf31196c2d550aaf7b43ee870c8feec86b5dd5f3bd73812ccb7485c0d469a5800095647e8af7ef368bd5eeed3bf6638f1eee3f
```

Generated with ``b2sum challenge``

### Hash of the response file

```bash
The BLAKE2b hash of `./response` is:
        48d85e60 2c905f81 8dc13996 4b969d28 
        1c7d629f 3bbc0354 c8a4ad37 97833c81

        0dd28cd2 1c891dab 4ccc2c98 b82d1525 
```

### Entropy source and precautions

- Randomly typing on the keyboard
- Recorded ~6.7 MiB of ephemeral conversations & voices. Encrypted shortly before contribution (with an XOR OTP sourced from /dev/urandom). The result was manually shuffled and mixed with randomly typed characters at various positions within the data. Deleted all content after the contribution
